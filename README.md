## Airline accidents
1. We could look at where around the globe airline accidents occur, and if there are any trends on types of airline or countries./regions they occur in.
2. Could determine what airlines are most and least safe.
3. have user input airpork code like JKF or LAX and have it filter a data table specifally for that.
4. d3 visualization of world globe that can show where the airline wrecks are around the world based on lat and long.
