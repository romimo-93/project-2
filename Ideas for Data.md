## International Tourism Demographics
### How
1. This dataset provides data on International inbound tourists (overnight visitors), International outbound tourists, and International tourism expenditures for every (or nearly every) country from 1960 to 2020.  There are honestly a million things I feel like we could do with this data, it's a super good source and would definitely provide a lot of good visualizations with any of the data we choose. https://www.kaggle.com/ayushggarg/international-tourism-demographics
